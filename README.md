# 🏓 mini_transcendence - Modern Pong Evolution 🚀 Enhanced with Ansible for Seamless Automation

### All microservices are optimized to run on an AWS Free Tier VPS (hosting the Pong SPA site at [link](https://transcendence.alematta.com/)), which involved removing extensive DevOps components like Grafana/Prometheus and ELK. The existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is currently paused as I work to integrate Ansible automation for future deployments.
