# 🏓 mini_transcendence - Modern Pong Evolution 🚀 Enhanced with Ansible for Seamless Automation

### All microservices are optimized using Alpine-based images, deployed on a Hetzner VPS (4GB RAM) hosting the Pong SPA site at [transcendence.alematta.com](https://transcendence.alematta.com/).

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the mini_transcendence platform, showing how traffic flows from the Internet through Cloudflare Tunnel (enabling HTTPS) to the VPS, where the Dockerized microservices and databases run behind an NGINX reverse proxy.

## 📊 Monitoring Stack

The platform includes a comprehensive monitoring solution:

### Grafana
- **Dashboard visualization** for all services and infrastructure metrics
- Accessible at `/grafana/` endpoint
- Pre-configured dashboards for Django services and node-exporter full. 

### Prometheus
- **Metrics collection** from all microservices
- Scrapes metrics from:
  - `auth-service`, `history-service`, `tournament-service` (Django Prometheus)
  - `node-exporter` (system metrics)
  - `postgres-exporter` (database metrics for all 3 PostgreSQL instances)
  - `nginx-prometheus-exporter` (reverse proxy metrics)
- 10-day data retention policy

### Alertmanager
- **Email notifications** for critical alerts
- Configured alert rules:

| Alert | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `InstanceDown` | 🔴 Critical | Any service instance down for >1 min |
| `PostgreSQLDown` | 🔴 Critical | PostgreSQL instance unreachable |
| `HighPostgresConnections` | 🟡 Warning | More than 100 active DB connections |
| `SlowQueries` | 🟡 Warning | Queries running slower than 5s average |
| `ReplicationLag` | 🔴 Critical | Replication delay exceeds 100 seconds |
| `LowDiskSpace` | 🔴 Critical | Database using more than 90GB disk |
| `HostHighCpuLoad` | 🟡 Warning | CPU load >80% for 5 minutes |
| `HostOutOfDiskSpace` | 🟡 Warning | Disk almost full (<10% left) |
| `HostOutOfMemory` | 🟡 Warning | RAM filling up (<10% left) |
| `NginxProxyDown` | 🔴 Critical | NGINX proxy down for >1 min |

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses a modern CI/CD pipeline managed via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/deploy.yml):

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Trigger:** On every push to the `main` branch
- **Steps:**
  - Checkout code
  - Generate dummy `.env` file for CI environment
  - Build all Docker images.
  - Run integration tests ( only backend auth-service)
  - Clean up containers.
  - Login to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** using `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Build and push Docker images to `ghcr.io` with commit SHA tags:
    - `ghcr.io/almat101/proxy:<sha>`
    - `ghcr.io/almat101/auth-service:<sha>`
    - `ghcr.io/almat101/tournament-service:<sha>`
    - `ghcr.io/almat101/history-service:<sha>`

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Trigger:** After successful CI completion
- **Steps:**
  - Checkout code
  - Set up Python 3.12, create virtual environment, and install Ansible
  - Install `community.docker` Ansible Galaxy collection
  - Export Hetzner VPS IP from GitHub secrets
  - Write Ansible vault password to a file from GitHub secrets
  - Write SSH key for the runner to connect to the VPS
  - Run Ansible deploy playbook to pull and deploy the latest Docker images to the Hetzner VPS

### Cleanup Job (Retention Policy)
- **Trigger:** After successful CI completion
- **Purpose:** Automatically manages container image retention in GitHub Container Registry
- **Steps:**
  - Cleans up old versions of each container image (`proxy`, `auth-service`, `tournament-service`, `history-service`)
  - **Keeps the 5 most recent versions** of each image
  - Deletes both tagged and untagged versions to save storage
  - Uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) for package management permissions

You can find the workflow definition in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
