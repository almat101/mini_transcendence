# Global settings
# Nginx Configuration File Documentation
#
# This configuration file sets up Nginx as a web server and reverse proxy with the following features:
#
# Basic Settings:
# - Runs as nginx user
# - Automatically determines optimal worker processes
# - Error logs stored in /var/log/nginx/error.log
# - PID file stored in /var/run/nginx.pid
#
# Performance Configuration:
# - 1024 worker connections per worker process
# - Enables sendfile for improved file serving
# - Gzip compression enabled for various content types
# - Keepalive timeout set to 65 seconds
#
# Security Features:
# - Server tokens disabled to hide version information
# - Real IP configuration for proper client IP handling behind proxies
# - Rate limiting zone defined (100 requests per second)
#
# Monitoring:
# - Prometheus metrics endpoint on port 8080
# - Stub status enabled for monitoring
# - Custom log format including X-Forwarded-For headers
#
# Additional Features:
# - Includes standard MIME types
# - Default application/octet-stream MIME type
# - External configuration files included from /etc/nginx/conf.d/
