# Keep the shell open so the venv remains active
# This script does not exit the shell, it just activates the venv within the current shell.
# If you run this script with `bash setup_ansible_venv.sh`, it will activate the venv
# in a sub-shell and then deactivate when the script finishes.
# To activate it in your *current* shell, you must `source` the script:
# `source setup_ansible_venv.sh` or `. setup_ansible_venv.sh`
